/**
 * Breadcrumb trail for inventory and landing pages.
 *
 * Replaces the three near-identical local `Breadcrumbs` helpers each listing
 * route defined for itself, and fixes two problems they all shared:
 *
 *  1. **No BreadcrumbList markup.** Only the vehicle detail page emitted
 *     breadcrumb JSON-LD, so Google rendered a bare URL instead of a
 *     `cars-365.com.au › Used Cars › Toyota` trail for every landing page.
 *     Rendering the trail here means publishing the markup is automatic.
 *  2. **Non-semantic markup.** The originals were a `<nav>` wrapping loose
 *     `<span>`s. This uses the project's existing (previously unused)
 *     `ui/breadcrumb` primitive — `<nav aria-label> › <ol> › <li>` with
 *     `aria-current="page"` — which is what assistive tech and crawlers parse
 *     as an actual hierarchy.
 *
 * "Home" is prepended automatically; callers pass only the trail below it.
 *
 * `suppressSchema` is for pages that already emit a BreadcrumbList inside a
 * larger `@graph` (the vehicle detail page bundles it with the Vehicle node).
 * Two BreadcrumbList blocks on one page is a structured-data error.
