/**
 * Site-wide entity graph (SRS §16.4) — three linked nodes:
 *
 *   • Organization  — the brand entity behind the knowledge panel. The site
 *     previously published none at all; the only builder for it lived in the
 *     dead rental-era `seo/schema.ts` and described the wrong business.
 *   • WebSite + SearchAction — makes the site eligible for a Google sitelinks
 *     searchbox, and was likewise never rendered anywhere.
 *   • AutoDealer    — the physical Granville storefront, linked to the brand
 *     via `parentOrganization` so the two don't compete as separate entities.
 *
 * All three carry stable `@id`s so per-page nodes (Vehicle offers, breadcrumbs,
 * collection pages) reference them instead of redeclaring detached copies.
 *
 * This lives in a component rather than only in `(public)/layout.tsx` because
 * the homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`) sits OUTSIDE the `(public)` route group —
 * it has its own light-theme shell — so a layout-only graph skipped the single
 * page where the Organization and SearchAction entities matter most.
 *
 * All three data reads are `unstable_cache`d, so rendering this on both the
 * layout and the homepage costs no extra queries.
